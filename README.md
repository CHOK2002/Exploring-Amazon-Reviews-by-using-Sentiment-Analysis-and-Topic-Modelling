## Background
Exploring Amazon product reviews for sentiment analysis and topic modeling is crucial because it provides actionable insights into customer satisfaction, preferences, and areas needing improvement. By understanding the sentiment and specific emotions expressed in reviews, Amazon sellers can assess overall product reception and address pain points that affect customer experience. Next, topic modeling further helps identify key aspects of products such as quality or usability that customers frequently discuss. These insights allow Amazon to make smart choices such as improving certain features, highlighting popular aspects in ads, and keeping a good brand image, which leads to happier customers and more loyalty.
